[[vaadin-grid.interaction]]
= User Interaction

Grid allows the user to interact with rows.

The `vaadin-grid-active-item-behavior` keeps track of the last user action, updating conveniently the `activeItem` property of the grid.

[[vaadin-grid.interaction.events]]
== Interaction API

The API is managed by one property and its corresponding `changed` event.

[propertyname]#activeItem#::
  It is the grid property that reflects the last item activated by the user, or null if there was no item activated.

[propertyname]#active-item-changed#::
  It is the event fired when an activation action happens.

[source,javascript]
----
// Log the active item to console
grid.addEventListener('active-item-changed', function(e) {
  console.log("Active-Item", grid.activeItem ? grid.activeItem : 'none');
});
